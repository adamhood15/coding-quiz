# Coding-Quiz
Module 4 Challenge for Rice Coding Bootcamp.

## Description
Welcome to my timed coding quiz challenge. This project was a great challenge for my JavaScript knowledge as it really pushed me to demonstrate my dom manipulation skills as well as my ability to dynamically create content. The goal was to build an application that dynamically updated content as users moved through the quiz while providing feedback for the user so they knew whether they missed the question or got it correct. This application tests your knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You have 60 seconds to answer five questions. Every time you answer correctly, you add five points to your score, but every time you miss a question you lose 5 points. Once completed you can put in your initials and you will see your name and score on the leaderboard.
